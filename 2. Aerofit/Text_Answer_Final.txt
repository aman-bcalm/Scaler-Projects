1) Problem Statement : Using the Aerofit_treadmill.csv data we can give Aerofit data driven / quantitatitve insights on what they've done
   so far and what would work for them in the future. Based on what we get to know from this data analysis (frequency, correlation etc) we
   can let them know statistically / graphically what is better for their business in the future based on a number of factors.

   General reccomendations (what suits the entire product range) as well as specific reccomendations both can be provided.
   


   Conversion of categorical attributes to 'category' is not required; rest is done in the Jupyter notebook.
   
4) Missing value : There are no missing values
   Outlier detection :
    
   1) Age: Last quartile is very big in range 33 to 50 relative to other quartiles hence 35+ can be considered outliers.
   2) Education : Last quartile is very big in range 16 to 21 relative to other quartiles hence 20,21 can be considered
      outliers as is also confirmed by the boxplot.
   3) Usage : 6 and 7 are outliers lying in the last quartile which has a big range relative to others and also can be
      confirmed from the BoxPlot
   4) Fitness : 1 is an outlier as there are pdf at 1 as well as the frequency is very low. It is the minimum value of the
      first quartile which is the biggest in this case.
   5) Income : 50% of the values are in the range 44-58k. Above 58k as can be confirmed from the pairplots as well there
       the number of buyers decreased and above 80k very sharply. So values above 80k can be considered outliers
   6) Miles : Fourth or last quartile range is 114 to 360 which is very large. As can be clearly observed from the pairplot as
              well values above 200 are clearly outliers.
			  
	
              
              
5) Business Insights based on Non-Graphical and Visual Analysis
    
    1) Comments on the range of attributes :
    
    1) Age: 50% customers are in the range 24 to 33. Target customer should be from 20 to 35 as most buyers are in that range.
    2) Education : 14, 16 and 18 values that need to be most focused on for sales in the range 14 to 18 rest don't contribute
       much to sales.
    3) Usage : 3 to 4 occur most often. We can consider the range 2 to 4 for the company that occurs most often and contributes
       to 75% of the values.
    4) Fitness : 1 is an outlier and the range 2 to 5 can be considered with special focus on 3
    5) Income : Looking at the pairplots and Quartiles we can say that 30 to 70k is the range wherein most the values lie.
    6) Miles : The last quartile is the biggest one rest all are fairly populated. Looking at pairplot we can say that the range
       to be considered should be 20 to 210 as more than 75% values lie within this range.
       
       
    2) Comments on the distribution of the variables and relationship between them :
    
    1) Distribution of variables : Most the variables seem to have a normal distribution with some amount of skewness towards
       the left or right.
       
    1) Age : Normal left skewed
    2) Education : Normal very slightly skewed to the left
    3) Usage: Normal skewed to the left
    4) Fitness : Normal with right skew
    5) Income : Normal skewed to the left
    6) Miles : Normal skewed to the left
    
    Relationship between them using pairplots (bivariate) :
    
    1) Age - Usage: The most frequent users are in the age group 20 to 35
    2) Age - Income : As age increases the income tends to increases
    3) Age - Miles : Most of the miles are covered by people in the age group 20 to 35
    4) Education - Usage : Does not seem to be much of a correlation between them
    5) Education - Fitness : Most educated people seem to be somewhat fit and very few are unfit i.e. 1 fitness rating
    6) Usage - Age : inversely correlated variables
    7) Usage - Fitness : Directly correlated. As usage increases so does fitness
    8) Usage - Miles : Directly correlated. More the usage , the more miles are covered
    9) Fitness - Miles : Directly correlated
    10) Income - Education : Directly correlated
    11) Income - Fitness : high income 80k plus people have high fitness mostly (mode) its 5
    
    etc
    
    Comments for each univariate and bivariate plot:
    
    1) Univariate
    
    1) Product : KP281 , KP481, KP 781 is the order of sales
    2) Age : 20-21 to 35 is the age range of most buyers with special focus on the range 23 to 26 both inclusive
    3) Education : 14, 16 and 18 are the most frequent values accounting for most of the distribution with 16 as the most
       frequent.
    4) Usage : 2,3,4 are the most frequent values and the values of the fitness variable decreasing linearly for values greater
       than 4
    5) Income : 30 to 70k is the range of income of of most users and with 50k range as the most frequent one
    
    
    2) Comment on heatmaps
    
    1) for the Age, Usage and Fitness plot
        
        1) for 22 year olds the fitness is high but the usage low
        2) Rest is normal observations
        
    2) for the Income, Usage and Fitness plot
    
        1) The most frequent income range 40 to 50k has low fitness (less than 3) and usage between 2 to 4 times a week
    
    3) for the Miles, Usage and Fitness
    
        1) Most people with fitness of 3 use the treadmill at in the range of 2 to 5 times and treadmill at least 100 miles a week
        

6) Reccomendations

    1) Most with with high income also have high fitness. They tend to buy KP781. Also probability that a female buys
       KP781 is very low. So KP781 should be targeted towards high income fitness enthusiast males.
    2) Being a female the probability of buying KP281 is very high. Hence for females KP281 followed by KP481 should
       be promoted aggressively and KP781 should not be promoted but kept in the range to make it complete keeping in mind
       the enthusiasts.
    3) Cities / neighborhoods which have the following majority demographic profile should be targeted :
       Education  : 14 to 18
       Age :  20 to 35
       Income : 30 to 70k
       Fitness : 3 to 5
    4) Looking at the conditional probabilities the sales staff can be handed a chart wherein when a customer walks in
       or in case of an online purchase once the age is known the right product can be suggested. For example for a 23 year
       old the probability of buying a KP281 is 44% and for a 22 year old it is 57%. For a 28 year old the probability of
       buying a KP281 is 67%.
    5) Rare to moderate users can be suggested KP 281 or KP 481 and high frequency users can be suggested KP781.
    6) For an online purchase or even for a walk in customer we can collect various data age, Gender, Usage, Fitness, Income etc
       and since we are aware of all the conditional as well as marginal probabilities we  calculate for each product the probability
       that the customer buys it and then reccomend him the products in the order suggested by the algorithm. In case lets say
       for KP481 we get the probability to be 0.6 then we know that this is almost sure shot so to increase the sales we can even
       offer a discount thus increasing lead conversion to customer time period.
    7) For privacy conscious customers we can tweak the algorithms to work with the data columns / probabilities for only the data points
       provided by the customer . So if the customer provided just age, income and fitness data then for him the algo would compute the
       P(KP281) and P(KP481) and P(781) only based on the age, income and fitness of other customers who've bought this product before.
    
    
    Lets say a 25 year old customer walks in with education 16 and rest of data he doesn't share with us then:
    p(KP281) = P(KP281| age = 25)P(age = 25) + P(KP281 | fitness = 16) P(fitness = 16)
    
    same for KP481 and KP 781 and based on this we can suggest the product
    
    The more data we get the better our algo will get ofc !
